                        <p>This Refund Policy contains the terms and conditions under which refunds may be provided to
                            Customers for Author Content and/or Author Services purchased on or through the Platform. By
                            making a purchase on the Marketplace or the Platform, You agree to be bound by this Refund
                            Policy. If You are a Customer, this Refund Policy is a part of the Customer Terms and
                            Conditions.</p>
                        <p>If You are an Author, this Refund Policy is a part of the Author Terms and Conditions.
                            Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Refund Policy, have the meaning assigned to
                            them in the applicable terms and conditions agreement.</p>
                        <p>Since the products sold by Authors on our Platform are digital goods, they cannot be
                            “returned.” Therefore, we have designed our refund policy with this in mind to ensure that
                            you are entitled to a fair refund if necessary.</p>

                            3.5 of the Customer Terms and Conditions. In case you encounter a technical problem with an
                            item you purchased from the “Blocks Store” on Appblocks, we suggest that you contact the
                            Author of the item for assistance. Often they’ll be able to help to troubleshoot your
                            problem.</p>
