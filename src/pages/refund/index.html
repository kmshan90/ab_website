                            Rules.
                            Because we are a platform, these
                            rules outline what you can expect from the authors of the items you buy. They apply to all
                            authors and customers.</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-[#242424] mb-3">The products that authors sell on the platform are
                            digital
                            goods and cannot be "returned", so
                            your entitlement to a refund is designed with this in mind. Of course, in addition to these
                            rules, each country has its own laws surrounding refunds, and these local laws are not
                            excluded if they apply to you.</p>
                        <div class="w-full float-left">
                            <h4 class="text-lg zirkon-medium text-ab-black mb-3">Before you ask for a refund from an
                                author</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-[#242424] mb-3">If you have purchased an item from our “Blocks” or
                                “Code” category on BlockStore and you
                                are experiencing a technical issue with the item we recommend that you contact the
                                author of that item and seek assistance. Often they’ll be able to help to troubleshoot
                                your problem.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div id="asking" class="w-full float-left mb-8">
                        <h3 class="zirkon-medium text-2xl text-ab-black mb-3">Asking for refunds from authors</h3>
                        <p class="text-sm text-[#242424] mb-3">We understand, however, that sometimes the author may not
                            be able to solve your issue or there may be circumstances in which a refund is warranted. In
                            this case, here are the circumstances in which we would expect an author to provide you with
                            a refund:</p>
                        <div class="w-full float-left">
                            <h4 class="text-lg zirkon-medium text-ab-black mb-3">Item is "not as described" or the item
                                doesn’t work the way it should.</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-[#242424] mb-3">If an item doesn’t work the way it should then the
                                author is required to promptly fix the issue by updating the item. An item is "not as
                                described" if it is materially different from the item description or preview. If the
                                issue can’t be fixed or it turns out that the item is “not as described” then you would
                                be entitled to a refund from the author.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="w-full float-left">
                            <h4 class="text-lg zirkon-medium text-ab-black mb-3">Item has a security vulnerability</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-[#242424] mb-3">If an item contains a security vulnerability and
                                can't easily be fixed you would be entitled to a refund from the author. If the item can
                                be fixed, then the author should do so promptly by updating the item. If the item
                                contains a security vulnerability that is not patched in an appropriate timeframe then
                                we would expect the author to provide a refund for the item.</p>
